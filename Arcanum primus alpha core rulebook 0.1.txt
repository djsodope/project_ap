These mechanics form the foundation of the Arcanum Primus combat and progression system. Every player, skill, and battle follows these rules unless otherwise modified by class, archetype, or special ability.
________________


🌀 Action Economy
Each player character has access to the following during their turn:
* 1 Action – Used to perform a skill or a Variable Basic Attack (VBA)
* 1 Bonus Action – Used for minor skills, utility effects, or movement tech
* 1 Reaction – Used on enemy turns to Parry, Dodge, or Jump
💡 Reactions are limited to one per round. You must choose wisely!
________________


🔋 Ability Points (AP) System
* Players start with 3 AP at Level 1
* Max AP is 10 (expanded via passives and level-ups)
* Skills cost between 2–5 AP depending on their power
* AP is not automatically replenished each turn — it must be earned through gameplay
🟩 AP Gain Methods:
* +1 AP when landing a successful VBA (basic attack)
* +1 AP on a Perfect Parry
* +1 AP from Support skills or passives
* Some passives may restore AP over time or after certain triggers
🧠 AP is a finite energy system. Managing your AP pool is key to long-term survival and burst timing.
________________


💥 Skill Structure
Skills are the heart of combat, each costing a set amount of AP and scaling by tier:
AP Cost
	Damage Roll
	2 AP
	1d6
	3 AP
	1d8
	4 AP
	2d6
	5 AP
	2d8
	* Higher-tier skills (Tier 4–7) cost 6–10 AP and have unique effects
* Most skills are locked by level and role
* Each skill belongs to a Role (DPS, Tank, Support) and sometimes an Archetype
________________


🛡️ Reaction System
During the enemy’s turn, players may use 1 Reaction per round. The 3 options are:
Parry – Block a hit with your weapon or power
* Roll d20 + WIS (or bonus based on WIS tier)
* Success = Take reduced damage
* Perfect Parry (18–19) = No damage + gain 1 AP
* Crit Parry (Nat 20) = No damage + 1 AP + Counterattack (with VBA or 2 AP skill)
Dodge – Swiftly evade an incoming hit
* Roll d20 + DEX
* Success = Graze (reduced damage)
* High roll (17+) = Avoid all damage
* Fails = Full damage taken
Jump – Leap out of hazard range
* Only usable when the GM signals a jump opportunity (e.g., AoE zone)
* Roll d20 + WIS or DEX (player choice)
________________


Gradient Gauge System (Arcanum Primus – Core Mechanics)
The Gradient Gauge is a shared cinematic energy meter used to unleash powerful team-based or solo ultimate techniques. It represents the flow of momentum, coordination, and dramatic energy in battle.
________________


🔋 How GP is Gained
* For every 5 skills used by the party (not VBAs), gain +1 Gradient Point (GP)
* GP is teamwide, not individual
* GP resets at the end of combat
________________


🎯 GP Cost Scales by Party Size
The more players in the party, the more GP is needed to activate powerful effects — this ensures balance and pacing.
Party Size
	Minor Technique
	Major Technique
	2 Players
	2 GP
	4 GP
	3 Players
	3 GP
	5 GP
	4 Players
	3 GP
	6 GP
	5+ Players
	4 GP
	7 GP
	* Minor Technique: A solo power-up, quick strike, buff, or cinematic evasion
* Major Technique: A full-party combo attack, burst heal, zone control, or fusion move
________________


🧠 Team Use Rules
* Only 1 player may spend GP per round
* Players must discuss and decide who gets to use the gauge
* GP is spent immediately once declared
________________


🌀 Echo Pulse Delay (Optional Upgrade – Level 30+)
Players may delay their right to use GP and reserve a “pulse” for future turns.
Rules:
* On their turn, a player may declare:


“I delay my Echo Pulse.”


* That player skips GP usage now but may use it in a future round, even if another player already used GP that round

* Only 1 reserve per player

* Cannot stack or delay endlessly

This allows two GP users in one turn (reserved + normal), breaking the usual limit.
________________


⚠️ Notes:
   * 1 Gradient Skill per round max, unless using Echo Pulse Delay
   * GP cannot be split or spent partially
   * Legendary passives or future Sigils may modify these rules
________________


🧱 Variable Basic Attack (VBA)
When a player doesn’t use a skill, they can always fallback to a free basic attack (0 AP):
Level Range
	Damage
	1–9
	1d4
	10–29
	1d6
	30–59
	1d8
	60–89
	2d6
	90–100
	2d8
	   * Add STR, DEX, or INT modifier (based on attack type)
   * Used for chip damage or to earn AP
________________


⚖️ d20 Resolution System
Almost all actions in Arcanum Primus rely on a d20 roll, modified by the relevant stat:
Roll Result
	Outcome
	1–6
	Miss or Fail
	7–12
	Graze or Partial
	13–19
	Hit / Full Success
	20+
	Critical Hit (x1.5 dmg or special effect)
	🎲 Stat Modifiers apply based on context:
   * STR: Melee attacks, knockback
   * DEX: Ranged attacks, Dodge rolls
   * CON: Status resistance
   * INT: Tech/magic accuracy, combo chains
   * WIS: Parry & Jump rolls
   * CHA: Buff/heal power, team synergy
________________


🔄 Turn Flow Summary
Player Turn:
   * Choose to use: 1 Skill (AP cost) or VBA (free)
   * Use Bonus Action (if available)
   * Store unused AP (if any)
Enemy Turn:
   * React once (Dodge, Parry, or Jump)
   * Track damage, effects, and AP gain


Reaction System – Parry, Dodge, Jump
Arcanum Primus Core Defense Mechanics
Every character gets 1 Reaction per round, which they can use during the enemy’s turn to mitigate or avoid damage. Reactions are critical to survival, defense strategy, and team synergy.
________________


🎯 Overview
Reaction
	Use Case
	Roll Modifier
	Outcome
	Parry
	Melee or ranged physical/magic hits
	WIS (or bonus)
	Block/reduce/negate damage, gain AP
	Dodge
	Avoid full-body attacks
	DEX
	Reduce or avoid damage
	Jump
	Escape AoE or hazards
	WIS or DEX (player choice)
	Evade entirely if successful
	⚠️ You may only use one Reaction per round, so choosing wisely is essential.
________________


⚔️ Parry
Block incoming attacks using weapons, powers, shields, or raw skill.
📘 Mechanics:
   * Roll: d20 + Parry Modifier
   * Default modifier = WIS, but...
   * If WIS is your lowest stat, you get a flat +1
   * If WIS is average (10–11), still +1
   * If WIS is above average, use your actual modifier
   * Max Parry Bonus = +4
🎲 Outcomes:
Roll Result
	Outcome
	1–12
	Fail – full damage taken
	13–17
	Normal Parry – take 50–80% damage (scales by level/perks)
	18–19
	Perfect Parry – take 0 damage, gain +1 AP
	20 (Nat)
	Crit Parry – 0 damage, +1 AP, Counterattack (use VBA or 2 AP skill)
	⚔️ Team Counter Bonus:
If all active players roll Perfect Parry in the same round, trigger a bonus Team Counterattack (regardless of level).
________________


💨 Dodge
Quickly evade incoming strikes or ranged energy.
📘 Mechanics:
   * Roll: d20 + DEX
🎲 Outcomes:
Roll Result
	Outcome
	1–12
	Fail – full damage taken
	13–16
	Graze – take half damage
	17+
	Full Dodge – take 0 damage
	❌ Dodging grants no AP on success.
________________


Jump (Updated with Team Counter Mechanic)
Jump is a reactive movement-based defense, triggered only by environmental threats like AoE blasts, collapsing terrain, magical implosions, or timed hazards.
________________


📘 Mechanics:
   * You may only use Jump when the GM signals a hazard
   * Example: "The reactor implodes — Jump now!"
   * Roll: d20 + WIS or DEX (your choice)
   * Can be used even if your WIS is low or DEX is average
________________


🎲 Outcomes:
Roll Result
	Outcome
	1–12
	Fail – full effect (e.g. full AoE damage, stun)
	13–16
	Partial – graze (reduced effect or minor status)
	17+
	Success – complete evasion, no effect
	________________


🧬 NEW: Team Counter Jump Attack
If all active players successfully Jump (roll 17+ in the same round), the team may immediately trigger a Counter Jump Attack.
📌 How It Works:
   * Everyone who succeeded may make a free attack using the VBA damage system
   * Use the same VBA dice you’d use for normal combat
   * You do not spend AP, but you do not gain AP from the hit either
   * Can target:
   * The source of the hazard (e.g. boss casting the AoE)
   * Or nearby enemies, based on GM discretion
🎬 This simulates the party leaping together in perfect sync, rebounding with a cinematic strike while dodging death.
________________


Example:
The enemy launches a massive explosion.
GM signals “Jump now!”
   * Player 1 (DEX build): Rolls 19 ✅
   * Player 2 (Support): Rolls 18 ✅
   * Player 3 (Tank): Rolls 20 ✅
✅ All succeed → trigger Counter Jump Attack!
Each of them now rolls their VBA damage as a free counter-strike.
________________


✅ Final Notes:
   * This feature mirrors Team Perfect Parry Counter rules
   * Counter Jump Attacks happen immediately after the hazard but before the next round begins
   * Only available once per encounter unless otherwise stated
________________


💡 Design Goals:
   * Give every player a defensive option, even with low stats
   * Encourage stat diversity (DEX for Dodge, WIS for Parry/Jump)
   * Create tension and tactical decision-making (you only get one reaction per round!)
   * Reward good timing and risk-taking with Perfect Parry bonuses and crit counters




Perfect vs Crit Parry Clarification
Understanding Defensive Roll Tiers in Arcanum Primus
In Arcanum Primus, Parry is a reaction-based defense roll using d20 + WIS (or a scaling bonus if WIS is low). The quality of your roll determines the level of protection — and whether you unlock bonus effects like AP gain or Counterattacks.
________________


🎯 Parry Outcome Table
Final Roll Result
	Result
	Effect
	1–12
	❌ Failed Parry
	Take full damage
	13–17
	✅ Normal Parry
	Take 50–80% damage, no AP gain (scales with level or passives)
	18–19
	🌟 Perfect Parry
	Take 0 damage, gain +1 AP
	20 (natural)
	💥 Critical Parry
	Take 0 damage, gain +1 AP, and trigger a Counterattack
	________________


🔍 Breakdown of Each Tier
✅ Normal Parry (13–17)
   * Reduces incoming damage, but does not negate it.
   * Offers no AP gain.
   * Effectiveness may improve with perks, passives, or level scaling (e.g., 80% block instead of 50%).
________________


🌟 Perfect Parry (18–19, natural roll only)
   * Fully negates the attack’s damage
   * Grants +1 AP
   * Can help trigger a Team Counterattack if multiple players roll Perfect Parry in the same round
   * Modified 18–19s do count for
________________


💥 Crit Parry (20 only)
   * Also fully negates damage
   * Grants +1 AP
   * Additionally triggers a free Counterattack:
   * Can use VBA or a 2 AP skill if you have AP
   * Applies immediately during the enemy turn
Crit Parry is the only way to counterattack solo at Level 1 (before the general Parry Counter unlocks at Level 10+)
________________


🧠 Key Balancing Notes
   * WIS bonus helps you succeed, but only raw 18–20 rolls trigger Perfect or Crit effects.
   * Players with low WIS still get a flat +1 bonus, so everyone has a chance.
   * Crit Parry is always rarer, and rewarded with a bigger payoff.
________________


🌀 Interaction with Team Mechanics
   * Perfect Parry (natural 18–19) contributes to Team Counterattack
   * Crit Parry (natural 20) also counts toward Team Counterattack
   * Only one counterattack per round unless special abilities override that rule




d20 Outcome Table
Universal Roll Resolution for Arcanum Primus
In Arcanum Primus, all important actions are resolved using a d20 roll — modified by a relevant stat. This includes attacks, skills, reactions, and combo triggers.
________________


🎯 Roll Outcome Breakdown
Roll (before mods)
	Outcome
	Description
	1–6
	❌ Miss / Fail
	The action fails. No damage, no effect, or a total whiff.
	7–12
	⚠️ Graze / Partial
	A partial hit. Deal reduced damage or weakened effect (GM-defined).
	13–19
	✅ Success / Hit
	Full hit. Apply skill or effect normally, including AP or condition triggers.
	20+
	💥 Critical
	Trigger a Critical Hit or Critical Effect (based on ability). Damage is increased or special rules apply.
	________________


🧠 Stat Modifiers & Roll Context
When making a d20 roll, you almost always add a relevant stat modifier based on the action:
Terrain & Hazard Interaction Rules
Action Type
	Modifier
	Melee Skill
	STR
	Ranged Skill
	DEX
	Magic/Tech Skill
	INT
	Dodge Reaction
	DEX
	Parry/Jump Reaction
	WIS
	Buff/Heal Power
	CHA
	Knockback Saves
	CON
	These modifiers shift the final result, allowing players with strong stats to graze less and crit more.
________________


⚔️ Critical Hit Rules (20+)
By default:
   * +50% total damage
🎯 Some abilities and passives have unique crit effects (e.g. “On crit: bleed 2 turns”)
You may also expand your crit range with Perfection stacks, Support skills, or magic boosts:
   * Example: Crit Range = 19–20 (instead of just 20)
________________


⚠️ Graze Rules (7–12)
If a roll lands in the graze range:
   * Damage or effect is cut in half, rounded down
   * Some status effects are reduced in duration or fail entirely
   * Reactions that graze (like Dodge or Jump) still partially protect
🛡️ Graze results are still meaningful — they represent tension, near-hits, or partial dodges.
________________


✅ Usage Scenarios
The d20 Outcome Table applies to:
Situation
	Outcome Type
	Attack rolls
	Miss / Graze / Hit / Crit
	Skill accuracy checks
	Same table
	Combo triggers
	Success if ≥13
	Reaction rolls
	Custom results by type (Dodge/Parry table)
	________________


Critical Hit Scaling by Level
Crit damage is +50% by default, with slight power growth as players ascend tiers:
Level Range
	Crit Bonus
	Lv 1–29
	+50% total damage
	Lv 30–59
	+60% total damage
	Lv 60–89
	+70% total damage
	Lv 90–100
	+80% total damage
	💡 This keeps crits exciting but controlled, with slight growth every 30 levels to reflect mastery and late-game scaling without overwhelming the core balance.
🔧 Optional Variants (For Future Development)
   * Crit Momentum: Gain +1 Gradient Point on crit
   * Crit Chain: Two crits in 1 round = Bonus Action refund
   * Crit Breaker: Crits bypass defense buffs or barriers


Status Effects System – Arcanum Primus
“A single affliction can break even the strongest will.”
________________


⚠️ Core Status Rules
   * Duration: Most effects last 1–3 rounds, unless cleansed or resisted.
   * Saving Throws: Each effect lists a Save Type (CON, WIS, etc.) and is set by the skill's DC.
   * Stacking: Effects do not stack unless specified (e.g., Bleed 2 = 2d4).
   * Trigger Timing: Effects activate immediately or at start/end of turn (see effect).
   * Cleansing: Removed by support skills, terrain, or specific gear/perks.

Gradient Gauge Scaling by Party Size
Team-Based Resource Balance for Cinematic Power
________________


💡 What Is the Gradient Gauge?
The Gradient Gauge is a shared team resource that builds up over time as players use skills. It fuels powerful, cinematic Gradient Skills that can turn the tide of battle.
         * The gauge is teamwide, not individual
         * Every 5 skills used by the party = +1 GP (Gradient Point)
         * GP is spent to activate special Gradient Skills, like Minor Finishers or Major Team Techniques
________________


⚖️ Why Scaling Is Needed
Without scaling, small teams (e.g. 2–3 players) would build GP much faster than full 4–5 player teams, leading to frequent, unbalanced Gradient usage.
To prevent this, GP costs for using Gradient Skills scale based on party size.

🌀 Additional Notes
         * GM may adjust costs for special encounters (e.g., boss fights may allow discounted Gradient use)
         * Certain Support or Passive skills may refund GP, or reduce cost once per battle
         * You can only use one Gradient Skill per round, even if you have excess GP
         * GP does not reset between turns, but may fade after combat ends (GM choice)
________________


✅ Summary
         * GP builds at a fair rate for any party size
         * Big parties take longer to charge, but unlock stronger, combo-based payoffs
         * Small parties gain faster but must spend carefully
This system keeps Gradient Skills special, dramatic, and strategic, not spammed or forgotten.

Terrain & Hazard Interaction System – Arcanum Primus
“The battlefield is a living weapon — master it, or be consumed by it.”
________________


🧱 Terrain Categories
1. Standard & Obstructive Terrain
Type
	Effect
	Open Ground
	No effects. Normal movement and line of sight.

	Costs +1 AP to use any skill in water; ranged attacks -1 to hit
	🔗 Chains / Webs
	STR or DEX check (DC 12) to move through or break
	Difficult Terrain
	Costs double movement to cross (e.g., rubble, water, sand)
	Cover (Half/Full)
	+2 or +4 to AC vs ranged attacks and AoE. Can be destroyed (HP 5–15)
	High Ground
	+1 to hit and damage with ranged attacks or spells
	Ledges / Cliffs
	Falling hazard. Knockback can trigger fall damage (1d6 per 10 feet)
	________________

	________________


🦘 Jump Interactions
Jump can be used to:
         * Evade terrain-based AoEs (e.g., collapsing bridge)
         * Leap over obstacles (rubble, pits, flames, etc.)
         * Reach ledges or elevated tiles (GM may call for DEX/STR check)
         * React to traps or environmental changes (on GM Jump Signal)
If all players Jump and succeed a GM-signaled hazard, they may trigger a Team Jump Counterattack (VBA damage for free).
________________


💢 Hazard Layering Rules
Multiple terrain effects can stack. Example:
         * A Frozen Floor covered in Necrotic Mist:
         * Half movement + WIS save or Fear
         * A fire-based attack may melt the terrain, removing the frozen state
________________


🧠 Terrain Strategy Tips
Role
	Best Use
	DPS
	Use high ground, trigger traps, destroy AoE structures
	Support
	Set up healing zones away from hazards, cleanse effects like Acid or Mist
	Tank
	Block off narrow paths, absorb terrain effects, knock enemies into danger
	________________


📏 Tile-Based Rules (Optional Grid Use)
         * Standard tile = 5 ft
         * Fire/Acid zones = 2x2 area
         * Jump clears up to 2 tiles
         * Elevation changes = +2 tiles to Jump DC
________________


🌀 Optional Terrain Traits (Future Expansion)
Terrain Feature
	Effect
	Shifting Floor
	Random tiles shift each round; DEX save or fall prone, lose 1 AP
	Magic Fog
	WIS check (DC 13) to target through; fail = miss, misplace, or fizzle
	Dimensional Tear
	Stepping on it teleports to a random location or hazard
	Gravity Reversal
	Gravity flips for 1–3 rounds; Jump becomes fall-prevention; fail = 1d6 damage
	________________


👁️‍🗨️ GM Usage Tips
         * Place 1–2 hazards per battlefield for tension
         * Mix terrain types to encourage reaction mechanics
         * Use glyphs, ledges, and shifting floors in boss fights
         * Let clever use of Jump, VCP, or Threads override dangers

         * Defeated — no d20 roll or damage calculation required
         * Removed from combat with a cinematic execution, styled to your class/archetype
Examples:
         * DPS cleaves through a goblin with no effort
         * Tank shoulder-checks a weakened drone into a wall
         * Supporter blasts a crawling creature with finishing magic
________________


🔁 Optional Cleave Variant (GM Discretion)
         * If a player is 5+ levels above a cluster of weak foes, they may:
         * Spend 2 AP for a Multi-Overkill Sweep
         * Defeat 2–3 valid targets at once (adjacent or in range)
This option is GM-triggered or approved only, meant for clearing filler mobs during fast dungeon pacing.
________________


🌀 Dungeon Flow Purpose
Overkill Strike supports the game loop of dungeon crawling:
         * You move through combat rooms efficiently
         * You're rewarded for level progression with “trash clear” dominance
         * It lets players conserve big AP skills for meaningful fights
________________


🚫 Narrative Restriction Reminder
Overkill Strike is disabled automatically in:
         * Major plot battles
         * Boss chambers
         * Cutscene-initiated encounters
         * Any enemy tied to lore, puzzles, or tactical structure

Variable Basic Attack (VBA) – Arcanum Primus
📌 What is a VBA?
A Variable Basic Attack (VBA) is the fallback, 0 AP attack available to all players. It’s used when a character:
         * Has no AP left
         * Wants to conserve AP
         * Is counterattacking with a Crit Parry
         * Needs to build AP (since a successful VBA hit gives +1 AP)
________________


🎯 Core Rules
         * VBA costs 0 AP
         * Can only be used once per turn as your main Action (not a Bonus Action)
         * Grants +1 AP if it hits
         * Damage scales by character level, encouraging higher-level characters to still have a reliable no-cost attack
         * Uses STR, DEX, or INT modifier depending on the character’s attack style:
         * STR for melee/physical
         * DEX for ranged/finesse
         * INT for elemental/tech-themed VBAs
________________


📈 VBA Damage Scaling Table
Level Range
	VBA Dice
	Lv 1–9
	1d4
	Lv 10–29
	1d6
	Lv 30–59
	1d8
	Lv 60–89
	2d6
	Lv 90–100
	2d8
	🧠 Example:
A Level 12 rogue-style character with DEX +3 uses a finesse VBA.
→ Rolls 1d6 + 3 damage.
If it hits, they gain +1 AP.
________________


💥 Crits and VBA
         * Crits still apply to VBAs (roll natural 20 → crit)
         * Crit effect = +50% total damage or double dice rolled (GM discretion)
         * On a Crit Parry, the counterattack can be a VBA or a 2 AP skill (if you have the AP to spend)
________________


🔁 Design Goals
         * Keeps low-level characters active when out of AP
         * Gives high-level characters a reliable low-cost option between big moves
         * Allows for precision or chip-damage playstyles
         * Makes counterattacks meaningful without needing AP saved up
How to Trigger It – Team Counterattack
To activate a Team Counterattack:
         * Every participating player must:

            * Use Parry as their Reaction

            * Roll a modified (dirty) 18–19, or a natural 20 (Perfect Parry)

The number of required qualifying rolls scales with team size:
Active Players
	Required Counter-Parry Rolls (Dirty 18–19 or Nat 20)
	2
	Both players must succeed
	3
	At least 2 players
	4
	At least 3 players
	5+
	At least 4 players
	✅ Dirty 18–19 counts toward triggering the team counter.
🎯 Only natural 20s are still considered Perfect Parries, which may have special passive effects elsewhere (e.g., class perks).
________________


💥 What Happens
When the threshold is met:
               * All players who rolled dirty 18–19 or nat 20 may make a free counterattack using their VBA (Variable Basic Attack)

✅ Counterattack Rules:
                  * Costs 0 AP

                  * Uses VBA damage scaling by level

                  * Adds STR, DEX, or INT modifier (based on weapon/skill type)

                  * Does NOT grant AP on hit

                  * Triggers immediately after the enemy’s turn, before the next player acts

________________


🧪 Example
3 players:
                     * Tank rolls 19 (after modifiers) ✅

                     * DPS rolls dirty 18 ✅

                     * Support rolls nat 20 ✅

→ All qualify → Team Counterattack is triggered
Each makes a free VBA attack, even with no AP remaining.
________________


🔒 Restrictions
                        * Once per encounter, unless modified by passives, Sigils, or Traits

                        * All participants must have used Parry

                        * Does not stack with Team Jump Counterattack

________________


🌈 Why This Mechanic Matters
                           * Boosts synergy without locking rewards behind raw luck

                           * Lets well-built characters contribute with smart stat investment

                           * Encourages team defense timing

                           * Enables Tank, Support, or hybrid builds to have offensive utility moments
 Jump Signal – GM Combat Tool
Reaction-Based Hazard Avoidance – Combat-Only Version
________________


🎯 What Is the Jump Signal?
The Jump Signal is a combat mechanic used by the GM to trigger environmental hazards or AoE attacks that players can avoid — but only if they use the Jump Reaction.
This gives Jump a unique defensive identity in combat, separate from Dodge and Parry.
________________


🧠 When to Use the Jump Signal (GM-Only)
The GM issues a Jump Signal during combat to represent:
Combat Scenario
	Examples
	Enemy AoE attacks
	Shockwaves, cone blasts, energy rings, boss jumps
	Battlefield shifts
	Collapsing floors, explosive crates, energy zones
	Stage mechanics
	Lava eruptions, electric pulses, rotating platforms
	Environmental triggers
	Falling debris, sudden poison clouds, crumbling ledges
	❗ This is not player-initiated. The GM says,
“⚠️ Jump now!”
…and any player may use their Reaction to attempt a Jump.
________________


🎲 Jump Reaction Roll
                              * Roll: d20 + WIS or DEX (player chooses)
                              * Jump is always a Reaction, and costs the only Reaction you get that round
Roll Result
	Effect
	1–12
	❌ Fail – full hazard damage or effect (GM defined)
	13–16
	⚠️ Graze – half damage or weakened effect
	17+
	✅ Success – avoid completely, land safe or repositioned
	________________


⚠️ Tactical Limitations
                              * You can only Jump if you haven’t already used your Reaction (Dodge, Parry, etc.)
                              * Some boss mechanics may require Jump to survive (e.g. unblockable floor wipe)
________________


💥 Optional Bonus: Team Jump Counterattack
If all active players succeed their Jump (17+), they unlock a free Team Jump Counterattack:
                              * Each player makes a free VBA attack (0 AP)
                              * Use normal VBA damage scaling + relevant mod (STR/DEX/INT)
                              * No AP is gained from this counterattack
                              * Happens immediately after the hazard resolves, before enemy turn ends
⚔️ Cinematically: the team leaps over danger and strikes back midair, anime-style.
________________


🌀 Why It Works in Combat
                              * Adds real-time tension and group synergy
                              * Keeps Reactions dynamic — Jump isn’t just a puzzle option
                              * Encourages movement-focused builds and awareness
                              * Supports cinematic combat pacing (boss fights, arena stages, setpiece turns)




Arcanum Primus – Boss Creation Guide (Lv 1–95)
“A boss is more than a bag of HP — it’s a test of synergy, survival, and style.”
You don’t have to follow this guide exactly, but it’s strongly recommended. It helps you avoid being a damage sponge DM, and ensures your bosses evolve with the party's mechanics and pacing.

🧪 Optional Rule: Ancestry Blending
With GM approval, players may mix 1 Trait and 1 Passive from two different races (e.g., Orc + Human) to reflect divine parentage, magical bloodlines, or experimental origins. These hybrids may gain unique flaws or bonus roleplay hooks.

“Their blood sings with power—but they are still bound by death. Born of divinity, tempered by mortality.”
These are the children of gods and mortals, created from direct unions, miracles, or divine experiments. Unlike full gods, they can be wounded, broken, or even slain — but their presence on the battlefield is unmistakable.

🧬 Notes on Demi-God Races:
                                    * Narrative Weight: Demi-god PCs are rare and draw attention in-world. GMs are encouraged to tie their origin into divine politics or prophecy.
                                    * Balance Clause: Despite their power, demi-gods are not immortal, and must follow standard death/damage rules unless stated otherwise.
                                    * Role Synergy: These races often synergize with Support (Phoenix-Born), Tank (Titanblood), or DPS (Stormblood) roles.
